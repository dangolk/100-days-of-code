# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Setup LAMP Stack and dev env. in XAMPP 7.2.1
2. Installed a bunch of IDEs (PHPStorm, WebStorm, Visual Studio Community 2017, etc.) and played with Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Enhancer.
3. Started using Trello for Project Management

**Thoughts:** I realized that spending some time to set up your development environment is important and that sometimes it takes longer than expected.

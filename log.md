* **Today's Progress**: 
  1. Installed DAMP stack for Drupal 7.56 and played with Drupal CMS' ecosystem
  2. Learned to create a Typeform (v2) as an interactive way for getting input from users

### Day 2: January 30, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: 
  1. Learned how to setup a Drupal Core CMS website (I used Drupal 7.56) on local machine and on a remote web server
  2. Setup MySQL Server Connection for Drupal on remote server via SSH and on local machine via phpMyAdmin
* **Thoughts:**
  1. Working with servers is not always as easy as it is locally. I ran into some permission issues on university's servers which were very restricting. So I'm looking into investing into external hosting.
